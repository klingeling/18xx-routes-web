        <h3>关于</h3>
        <p>
            18xx 路线计算器是 18xx 系列桌游的辅助工具
            (例如<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17405/1846-race-midwest" target="_blank">1846: 美国中西部铁路竞速</a>),
            to make route calculations easier and faster in-game. For that reason, they do <i>not</i> implement the
            entire ruleset; just enough to allow you to run routes, and some checks to prevent you from entering
            illegal board states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place tiles by clicking on the board, then selecting a tile and orientation from the resulting modal. Only
            legal tiles and orientations are displayed. Railroads and private companies can be added via the tabs to
            the right of the board (or below it, if you have a very narrow screen). This game state is automatically
            saved in your browser, and loaded next time you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            To calculate a route, click the Calculate button and select a railroad. Only railroads with at least 1 train
            can be picked. Each route is displayed in text to the right on the map, and drawn on the map.
        </p>
